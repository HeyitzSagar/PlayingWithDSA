What is node js ?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript
runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser,
enabling them to create scalable and high-performance applications.

What is Express ? 

Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, 
designed to make building web applications and APIs easier and
more efficient. It provides a robust set of features for web
and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support,
templating engines, and much more. 

What is routing in Node JS ? 
Routing in Node.js refers to the process of determining 
how an application responds to client requests to different
endpoints (URLs). It involves mapping HTTP requests 
(such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific pieces of code 
or handlers that are responsible 
for processing those requests and generating appropriate responses.

What is Middleware in Node JS ? 
Middleware in Node.js refers to functions that have access to the 
request and response objects in the HTTP request-response cycle. 
These functions can perform tasks such as modifying request or response
objects, executing additional code, terminating the request-response 
cycle, or passing control to the next middleware function in the stack.

How Node JS handles concurrency issues ?
Node JS handles concurrency through its event driven, non-blocking I/O models

Some of the list are as below:

It uses event loop to handle concurrency issues.
Callbacks and Promises
Wokers threads and cluster

What is JWT ? How do you authenticate with JWT ?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token. 
It is a compact and self-contained way of securely 
transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization 
in web applications.
A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.
These parts are separated by dots ('.'). The header typically contains
information about the type of token and the hashing algorithm used.

What is Socket ? 
A socket is a communication endpoint that allows two different 
processes to communicate with each other, either on the same machine 
or over a network. Sockets enable bidirectional data transfer between 
a client and a server, facilitating real-time communication between 
applications.

What are the main modules of node JS ?

HTTP, FS, stream, util, crypto, os and so on.
